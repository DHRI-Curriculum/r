# Which language should you learn?

Just as choosing which language you will use for your foreign language requirement is based on your research question, there are multiple programming languages you can choose to learn for DH. R and python are the most common. 

How much of the language do you need to learn? 

Does your project require basic fluency or only reading comprehension? 


# Python 

[Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

# R 

[R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))

Learning R fundamentals is a gateway to analyzing data, creating visualizations, composing interactive websites, scraping the internet, and engaging in distant reading of texts.
