# R 

R is a general-purpose programming language that is suitable for a wide variety of core tasks in the digital humanities. Learning R fundamentals is a gateway to analyzing data, creating visualizations, composing interactive websites, scraping the internet, and engaging in distant reading of texts. This session in R fundamentals also introduces essential computing concepts such as [data types, iteration, input/output, control structures, and importing libraries]. This session will serve as a basis for later sessions in databases, natural language processing, and working with APIs.

We will do this by [LEARNING OBJECTIVES: LIST ALL THE THINGS WE WILL Learn to DO]. 	

At the end we will have [CHALLENGE ACTIVITY] where we use what we learned to do something, ex. Scavenger hunt.
