# R 

R is a general-purpose programming language that is great for the digital humanities. The R fundamentals session is an introduction to the essentials of R and the Tidyverse.

We will do this by introducing some essential parts of R and then working through [Chapter 1](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html) of [Text Mining With R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).

By the end, we will have imported multiple classic books into R and compare word usage between their authors.
